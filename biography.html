				<p class=portrait1 id=text> The Weeknd, born Abel Makkonen Tesfaye on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Canada, grew up in a household influenced by Ethiopian culture. Raised by his mother and grandmother, he learned Amharic, the Ethiopian language, and was exposed to a mix of Ethiopian music, R&B, and pop. As a teenager, he struggled in school and eventually dropped out. During this time, he experimented with music and developed a unique style. </p>

			<p class=portrait2 id=text>In 2010, Abel anonymously uploaded three songs to YouTube under the name "The Weeknd." The mysterious sound and image quickly attracted attention. In 2011, he released three mixtapes—House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence—which gained him a loyal fanbase. These projects led to collaborations with major artists, including Drake. By 2013, he released his first studio album, Kiss Land, which introduced him to an even wider audience.</p>
